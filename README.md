# First_SeleniumPythonProject



My first Selenium Project written in Python.

A simple Eccommerce site automation that selects an item in the shop, confirm and assert at the end.
Containts an error logging, debug report and screenshot taking.
Also an extra feature of using Excel file - read and write on/from it and use it as a data storage to fill in text fields on page.


Requirments to run:

up to date Python release, Selenium Chrome driver (prefferable).



Runable files:

Root Folder ---> Tests ----> test_e_ccomerce.py
Root Folder ---> Tests ----> test_HomePage.py
Root Folder ---> Excel_Data ----> excelDemo.py
